# eer_product

oxes has arrows pointing to them from the corresponding process block.

Flow Representation:

The development starts with Requirement Analysis.

The Development phase follows, where features are implemented in increments.

The Testing & Integration phase ensures each increment is verified and integrated with the existing system.

Each process phase outputs an incremental version of the system.

The final version is achieved after multiple increments and refinements.

Diagram Styling Suggestions:

Use light blue rounded rectangles for each box.

Arrows should clearly indicate flow directions.

Group the three central process boxes together within a shaded area labeled "Concurrent Activities".
